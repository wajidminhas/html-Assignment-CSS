<br/> Ain Razat is the most important source of spring water in Dhofar. It used to be one of the main sources of water for Salalah. It's water, as well as several smaller springs, flow into a long pool on the northern side of the carpark at the foot of the Jebel. Water flows along a falaj (watercourse) throughout the year, although flow is highest during the Kharif. This water flows 7 km to Al-Mamurah Palace, the Sultanâ€™s residence when in Salalah. A further 3 km further on the watercourse reaches Razat Farm.

Fresh-water spring and picnic area near Salalah. The formal garden area is apparently open on Friday only, however, the broader area and spring is very nice. Signs warn against swimming due to risks of Bilharzia.
